# Practical sessions on mobile robot control

This page describes how to set up and run a practical session. We assume that your computer has been booted on the Linux Ubuntu operating system (available in the classroom). So if your are currently on Windows, you have to restart your machine to boot on Ubuntu instead.

Open a terminal and go to the `Document` directory:

    cd ~/Documents

Then copy the material of the session on your machine by running:

    git clone git@github.com:clement-moulin-frier/pyvrep-epuck.git

Go to the downloaded directory:

    cd pyvrep-epuck

Start the interactive environment we'll use in the practical sessions:

    ipython notebook

This will open a page on your browser, showing a tree view of the directory you've downloaded. Click on the `notebooks` directory, then on the file `practical_session_1.ipynb`. This will open a document in a new tab in your browser entitled *First step with the simulator*.

The rest of the session is described in this freshly opened document, please continue from there.
